^^ THESE NUMBERS ARE THE GAME SETTINGS, changing them and SAVING the document will change the game settings.
In order those numbers are
MINECOUNT
X SIZE OF THE FIELD (number of colmuns)
Y SIZE OF THE FIELD (number of rows)

please note that if you have resolution of 1366*768 and you have your taskbar on the bottom of the screen
the maximum size of the field that can fit on your screen is 33*17, for FULL-HD (1920*1080) the maximum is 50*25.
the maximum amount of mines you can fit on the borard is about size_x*size_y - 9.
Sometimes, however, when you use numbers close to the max amount of mines the generating will get stuck.
